# Architecture Decision Making

## Overview
Architecture decisions shape the system for years. Making them explicit reduces drift and keeps trade-offs visible.

## Core concepts
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs): capture decision, rationale, alternatives, and consequences.
- Decision drivers: quality attributes, constraints, and business goals.
- Architecture review checklist: a lightweight way to detect gaps and risk.
- New service design: define problem, constraints, options, and a clear decision.
- Build vs buy: compare strategic fit, total cost, and operational impact.

## Decision considerations / trade-offs
- More governance reduces risk but can slow delivery.
- Documenting decisions adds overhead but prevents repeated debates.
- Centralized decisions improve alignment but reduce team autonomy.
- Buying reduces time-to-market but can limit customization and control.
