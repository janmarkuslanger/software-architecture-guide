# Architecture Communication

## Overview
Architecture only works if it is understood. Clear communication aligns teams, reduces hidden assumptions, and makes trade-offs visible.

## Core concepts
- Stakeholders and viewpoints: engineers, product, operations, security, and compliance have different views.
- Diagram hygiene: consistent notation, clear legends, and minimal clutter.
- Narrative context: explain the why behind diagrams like goals, constraints and trade-offs.
- Explicit communication: state assumptions, goals, non-goals and risks.
- Living documentation: keep diagrams close to code and update with changes.
- Adapt to context: the level of documentation should match the complexity and needs of the project.

## Decision considerations / trade-offs
- More detail improves accuracy but increases maintenance cost.
- Async docs scale better; live walkthroughs improve shared understanding.
- Diagram choice should match the question, not the tool.
